## CodeNotary - The Trust and Integrity platform for the Cloud native environment

immudb is a **lightweight, high-speed immutable database** for systems and applications. With immmudb you can
track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a
tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of sensitive data, for example debit/credit card transactions.

Traditional transaction logs are hard to scale and are mutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised.

As such, immudb provides **unparalleled insights** **retroactively** of changes to your sensitive data, even
if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using a **Merkle tree structure** internally.

immudb gives you the same **cryptographic verification** of the integrity of data written with **SHA-256** like a classic blockchain without the cost and complexity associated with blockchains today.
