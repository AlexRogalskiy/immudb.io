## Connection and authentication

Immudb run on 3323 default port. Here we connecting a client with default options and
authenticating using default username and password.
It's possible to modify defaults on immudb server config folder inside `immudb.toml`
:::: tabs

::: tab Go

Login method return a token needed in all interactions with the server.

```go
c, err := client.NewImmuClient(client.DefaultOptions())
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
ctx := context.Background()
// login with default username and password and storing a token
lr , err := c.Login(ctx, []byte(`immudb`), []byte(`immudb2`))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
// set up an authenticated context that will be required in future operations
md := metadata.Pairs("authorization", lr.Token)
ctx = metadata.NewOutgoingContext(context.Background(), md)
```

### Mutual tls
To enable mutual authentication a certificate chain need to be provided both to the server and to the client.
With this they will authenticate each other at the same time
In order to generate them it's possible to use openssl tool.
[generate.sh](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb/tree/master/tools/mtls) provides a quick solution to provide them.
```bash
./generate.sh localhost mysecretpassword
```
This generates a list of folder containing certificates and private key to set up a mTLS connection
:::: tabs

::: tab Go
```go
	client, err := c.NewImmuClient(
		c.DefaultOptions().WithMTLsOptions(
			c.MTLsOptions{}.WithCertificate("{path-to-immudb-src-folder}/tools/mtls/4_client/certs/localhost.cert.pem").
				WithPkey("{path-to-immudb-src-folder}/tools/mtls/4_client/private/localhost.key.pem").
				WithClientCAs("{path-to-immudb-src-folder}/tools/mtls/2_intermediate/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem").
				WithServername("localhost"),
				).
			WithMTLs(true),
		)
	if err != nil {

	ctx := context.Background()
	// login with default username and password
	lr , err := client.Login(ctx, []byte(`immudb`), []byte(`immudb`))

### Disable authentication
It's possible to run immudb with disabled authentication.
Without enabled authentication it's not possible to connect to a server that own already databases and users permissions.
If a valid token is present authentication is being enabled by default.

```go
    client, err := c.NewImmuClient(
		c.DefaultOptions().WithAuth(false),
	)

## State management

Immudb client need to store somewhere the server state. In this way every verified read or write operation can be checked on a trusted state.

:::: tabs

::: tab Go
The component in charge of state handling is the `StateService`.
To set up the `stateService` 3 interfaces need to be implemented and provided to the `StateService` constructor:
* `Cache` interface in the `cache` package. Standard cache.NewFileCache provides a file state store solution.
* `StateProvider` in the `stateService` package. It provides a fresh state from immudb server when the client is being initialized for the first time. Standard StateProvider provides a service that retrieve immudb first state hash from a gRPC endpoint.
* `UUIDProvider` in the `stateService` package. It provides the immudb identifier. This is needed to allow the client to safely connect to multiple immudb instances. Standard UUIDProvider provides the immudb server identifier from a gRPC endpoint.

Following an example how to obtain a client instance with a custom state service.
```go
    func MyCustomImmuClient(options *c.Options) (cli c.ImmuClient, err error) {
    	ctx := context.Background()

    	cli = c.DefaultClient()

    	options.DialOptions = cli.SetupDialOptions(options)

    	cli.WithOptions(options)

    	var clientConn *grpc.ClientConn
    	if clientConn, err = cli.Connect(ctx); err != nil {
    		return nil, err
    	}

    	cli.WithClientConn(clientConn)

    	serviceClient := schema.NewImmuServiceClient(clientConn)
    	cli.WithServiceClient(serviceClient)

    	if err = cli.WaitForHealthCheck(ctx); err != nil {
    		return nil, err
    	}

    	immudbStateProvider := stateService.NewImmudbStateProvider(serviceClient)
    	immudbUUIDProvider := stateService.NewImmudbUUIDProvider(serviceClient)

    	customDir := "custom_state_dir"
    	os.Mkdir(customDir, os.ModePerm)
    	stateService, err := stateService.NewStateService(
    		cache.NewFileCache(customDir),
    		logger.NewSimpleLogger("immuclient", os.Stderr),
    		immudbStateProvider,
    		immudbUUIDProvider)
    	if err != nil {
    		return nil, err
    	}

    	dt, err := timestamp.NewDefaultTimestamp()
    	if err != nil {
    		return nil, err
    	}

    	ts := c.NewTimestampService(dt)
    	cli.WithTimestampService(ts).WithStateService(stateService)

    	return cli, nil
    }
```

## Tamperproof writing and reading

It's possible to read and write with built-in cryptographic verification.


### Verified get and set
The client implements the mathematical validations, while your application uses a traditional read or write function.

:::: tabs

::: tab Go
```go
	tx, err := client.VerifiedSet(ctx, []byte(`hello`), []byte(`immutable world`))
    if  err != nil {
    	log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	fmt.Printf("Successfully committed and verified tx %d\n", tx.Id)

    entry, err := client.VerifiedGet(ctx, []byte(`hello`))
    if  err != nil {
    	log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	fmt.Printf("Successfully retrieved and verified entry: %v\n", entry)
```

## Writing and reading

Writing and reading data is the same both in Set and VerifiedSet.
The only difference is that verifiedSet returns to the client proofs needed to mathematically verify that the data was not tampered.
Proof generation slightly impact on performances, so primitives are being allowed also without proofs.
It is still possible get the proofs for a specific item at any time, so the decision on the frequency checks it's completely up to the final users.
It's possible also to use dedicated [auditors](immuclient/#auditor) to ensure the database consistency, but the pattern in which every client is an also an auditor is the more interesting one.

### Get and set

:::: tabs

::: tab Go
```go
    tx, err = client.Set(ctx, []byte(`hello`), []byte(`immutable world`))
	if  err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Successfully committed tx %d\n", tx.Id)

	entry, err := client.Get(ctx, []byte(`hello`))
	if  err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Successfully retrieved entry: %v\n", entry)

## History
Immudb is an append only database.
This means that an update is a new insert of the same key with a new value.
It's possible to retrieve all the values for a particular key with the history command.

`History` accepts the following parameters:
* `Key`: a key of an item
* `Offset`: the starting index (excluded from the search). Optional
* `Limit`: maximum returned items. Optional
* `Desc`: items are returned in reverse order. Optional
* `SinceTx`:

:::: tabs

::: tab Go
```go
    client.Set(ctx, []byte(`hello`), []byte(`immutable world`))
	client.Set(ctx, []byte(`hello`), []byte(`immudb`))
	
	req := &schema.HistoryRequest{
		Key: []byte(`hello`),
	}

	entries, err := client.History(ctx, req)
	if  err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Successfully retrieved %d entries for key %s\n", len(entries), req.Key)

## References
`SetReference` is like a "tag" operation, it appends a reference on a key/value element.
As a consequence when we retrieve that reference with a `Get` or `VerifiedGet` the value retrieved will be the original value associated to the original key.
VerifiedReference counterpart is the same but in addition it produces also the inclusion and consistency proofs.

### SetReference and verifiedSetReference

## Secondary indexes

On top of the key value store immudb provides secondary indexes to help developers to handle complex queries.

### Sorted sets
The simplest secondary index you can create with immudb is by using the sorted set data type, which is a data structure representing a set of elements ordered by a floating point number which is the score of each element.
The reason we used a float64 as a score type is to satisfy the maximum number of uses cases.
64-bit floating point gives a lot of flexibility and dynamic range, at the expense of having only 53-bits of integer.

When an integer64 is cast to a float there could be a loss of precision, but the insertion order is granted by the internal database index that is appended to the internal index key.

`ZAdd` can reference an item by `key` or by `index`.

`ZScan` accepts following arguments:

* Set: the name of the collection
* SeekKey
* SeekScore
* SeekAtTx
* InclusiveSeek
* Limit: the maximum items returned,
* Desc: items are returned in score ascending or descending order
* MinScore: minimum score filter
* MaxScore: maximum score filter
* SinceTx

## Transactions

`GetAll`, `SetAll` and `ExecAll` are the foundation of transactions in immudb. They allow the execution of a group of commands in a single step, with two important guarantees:
* All the commands in a transaction are serialized and executed sequentially. It can never happen that a request issued by another client is served in the middle of the execution of a transaction. This guarantees that the commands are executed as a single isolated operation.
* Either all of the commands or none are processed, so the transaction is also atomic.

### execAll
`ExecAll` permits many insertions at once. The difference is that is possible to to specify a list of a mix of key value set, reference and zAdd insertions.
The argument of a ExecAll is an array of the following types:
* `Op_Kv`: ordinary key value item
* `Op_ZAdd`: [ZAdd](#sorted-sets) option element
* `Op_Ref`: [Reference](#references) option element

It's possible to persist and reference items that are already persisted on disk. In that case is mandatory to provide the index of the referenced item. This has to be done for:
* `Op_ZAdd`
* `Op_Ref`
If `zAdd` or `reference` is not yet persisted on disk it's possible to add it as a regular key value and the reference is done onFly.

## Multi databases
Starting immudb version 0.7.0 we introduced a multi-database support.
By default the first database is either called `defaultdb` or based on the environment variable `IMMUDB_DBNAME`.
Handling users and database require to have rights privileges.
Users with `PermissionAdmin` can control everything. Non admin users have restricted permissions and can read or write only their databases if they have sufficient privileges.
:::: tabs
In this example is shown how to create a new database and how to write into it.
In order to create a new database is possible to use `CreateDatabase` method.
::: tab Go
In order to write into a specific database an authenticated context is required.
It's possible with `UseDatabase` method to obtain a `token`.
A token is used not only for authorization  but also to route commands to a specific database.
To set up an authenticated context is sufficient to put a `token` inside metadata.
```go
	client, err := c.NewImmuClient(c.DefaultOptions())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	ctx := context.Background()
	lr , err := client.Login(ctx, []byte(`immudb`), []byte(`immudb`))

	md := metadata.Pairs("authorization", lr.Token)
	ctx = metadata.NewOutgoingContext(context.Background(), md)

	err = client.CreateDatabase(ctx, &schema.Database{
		Databasename: "myimmutabledb",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	dbList, err := client.DatabaseList(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("database list: %v", dbList)

	// creating a context to write in the new database
	resp, err := client.UseDatabase(ctx, &schema.Database{
		Databasename: "myimmutabledb",
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("auth token: %v", resp.Token)

	md = metadata.Pairs("authorization", resp.Token)
	ctx = metadata.NewOutgoingContext(context.Background(), md)
	// writing in myimmutabledb
	_, err = client.Set(ctx, []byte(`key`), []byte(`val`))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
