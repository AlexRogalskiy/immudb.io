```
docker run -it -d -p 3323:3323 --name immugw --env IMMUGW_IMMUDB-ADDRESS=immudb codenotary/immugw:latest
```

## Run immugw

Simply run ```./immugw -d``` to start immugw on the same machine as immudb (test or dev environment) or pointing to the remote immudb system ```./immugw --immudb-address "immudb-server"```.

If you want to stop immugw Ã®n that case you need to find the process `ps -ax | grep immugw` and then `kill -15 <pid>`. Windows PowerShell would be `Get-Process immugw* | Stop-Process`.

## Configuration

## immugw service

Please make sure to build or download the immugw and immuadmin component and save them in the same work directory when installing the service.

```
# install immugw service
./immuadmin service immugw install

# check current immugw service status
./immuadmin service immugw status
