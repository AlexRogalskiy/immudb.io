## The Trust and Integrity platform for the Cloud native environment
Give any digital asset a meaningful, globally-unique, immutable identity that is authentic, verifiable, traceable from anywhere. 

When using CodeNotary vcn in source code, release, deployment or at runtime, you allow a continuous trust verification that can be used to detect unusual or unwanted activity in your workload and act on it. 
Powered by CodeNotary's digital identity infrastructure, vcn lets you notarize all of your digital assets that add a trust level of your choice, custom attributes and a meaningful status without touching or appending anything (unlike digital certificates).
That allows change and revocation post-release without breaking any customer environment.

Everything is done in a global, collaborative way to break the common silo solution architecture. Leveraging an immutable, always-on DLT platform allows you to avoid complex setup of Certificate authorities or digital certificates (that are unfit for DevOps anyway).
